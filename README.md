# Anna's Torrents

Small python program to download torrents and provide similar functionality as https://annas-archive.org/torrents but actually giving users the files instead of a json with metadata and information on where to find the torrent files. 

Now linked on the [Anna's Archive](https://annas-archive.org/torrents#generate_torrent_list) website!

## Usage

- Run the program using python, and use the command line (CLI) and follow the prompts given.
- Torrents will be added to the `/torrents` directory, which will be created if it doesn't exist yet.
- The program will ask for the number of terabytes (TB) you would like to download and then will ask you to confirm. 
- Information on progress and torrents will be provided as downloaded.

## What next?

This program only generates the `.torrent` files to use. 
- To actually download and help seed the files, use a torrent client!
- [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/) is recommended because it's open source, powerful, and reliable.
- Many other clients have issues such as malware, ads, and they can be less efficient.
- These torrents probably won't get you in trouble with anti-piracy agencies, but just to be safe, use a VPN when you are downloading or seeding.
