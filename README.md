# Anna's Torrents

Small python program to download torrents and provide similar functionality as https://annas-archive.org/torrents but actually giving users the files instead of a json with metadata and information on where to find the torrent files. 

Now linked on here, on the [Anna's Archive](https://annas-archive.org/torrents#generate_torrent_list) website!
